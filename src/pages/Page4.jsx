                “Having suffered with chronic anxiety, panic attacks and depression for a number of years,
                I was desperately looking for a natural way out. Exploring, science, religion, philosophy,
                spirituality trying to understand why I was feeling this way.
              </p>

              <p className='mt-5'>
                My research & readings led me to understand how powerful our thoughts are and how
                fearful, worrying, negative thoughts trigger our fight or flight survival mode causing the
                physical feeling of anxiety.
              </p>

              <p className='mt-5'>
                Once I began to understand this, I set off on a quest to learn how to quieten my mind and
                got myself back to a place of peace, calm & zen. To share what I had learned I created a 4
                step process audio programme to help reach to more people. I hope it can help you too.”
